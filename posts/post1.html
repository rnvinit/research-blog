<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
This study presents an AI-driven adaptive learning framework that integrates
Q-learning with generative AI techniques to personalize learner experiences.
The objective is to dynamically adjust content difficulty and feedback based
on learner performance and interaction patterns.
</p>

<h3>Problem Context</h3>
<p>
Conventional e-learning systems often rely on static learning paths that do not
consider variations in learner knowledge, engagement, or learning speed.
Such approaches limit personalization and may negatively affect motivation
and long-term retention.
</p>

<h3>Methodology</h3>
<p>
The proposed framework models content selection as a reinforcement learning
problem. Learner performance and engagement indicators are mapped to system
states, while learning materials of varying difficulty represent actions.
Q-learning is employed to update action-value estimates based on reward signals
derived from learner outcomes and progression.
</p>

<h3>Results & Observations</h3>
<p>
Experimental evaluation indicates that adaptive content selection improves
learner engagement and interaction when compared to static learning systems.
However, early-stage performance varies across learners due to limited initial
information, highlighting the cold-start challenge inherent in reinforcement
learning approaches.
</p>

<h3>Limitations</h3>
<p>
The current implementation relies on manually designed reward functions and
limited engagement indicators. Scalability across large learner populations
and robustness to sparse interaction data remain open challenges.
</p>

<h3>Conclusion & Future Work</h3>
<p>
The findings demonstrate the potential of reinforcement learning for adaptive
education. Future work will explore hybrid approaches that combine Q-learning
with generative models to provide richer feedback and improved cold-start
performance.
